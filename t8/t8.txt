In OAuth2, The difference between a refresh token and an access token:

Access tokens:
**************
* Access tokens do not have to be in any particular format,
  and in practice, various OAuth servers have chosen many
  different formats for their access tokens
* Access tokens must not be read or interpreted by the OAuth client.
  The OAuth client is not the intended audience of the token.
* Access tokens do not convey user identity or any other information about the user to the OAuth client.
* Access tokens should only be used to make requests to the resource server.
  Additionally, ID tokens must not be used to make requests to the resource server.


Refresh Tokens:
***************
* A refresh token is a special token that is used to obtain additional access tokens
* This allows you to have short-lived access tokens without having to collect credentials every time one expires
* A refresh token must not allow the client to gain any access beyond the scope of the original grant.
* The refresh token exists to enable authorization servers to use short lifetimes
  for access tokens without needing to involve the user when the token expires.
